### Welcome!

Hope you are having a wonderful day. My name is Jorge Gonzalez and I would like to welcome you to my blog.

### What to expect?

As mentioned in the blog's sub-title, I have deep interests in Cyber Security, Software Development, and Web Design.
My goal for this blog is to really document everything that I've learned and everything that I will be working on.

### Why *ZeroBunks*?

The blog's name is inspired by my two dogs, *Bunky* and *Zero*, who are a constant source of inspiration for me. Their neverending curiosity and playful natureperfectly reflect the spirit of this blog. I couldn’t think of a better name than one that honors them. <br>

Once I take some great photos of them, I’ll be sure to share them here.
